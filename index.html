    <p> The audio design of Sky: Children of the Light is an essential part of its immersive and emotional experience.
    The music, composed by Vincent Diamante, blends orchestral and ambient elements to evoke feelings of wonder, joy, and introspection. 
    Each realm features unique compositions that reflect its mood, from tranquil melodies in peaceful areas to intense crescendos during dramatic moments. 
    The dynamic score adapts seamlessly to gameplay, reinforcing themes of exploration and connection.
    Environmental sound design further enhances immersion, with lifelike ambient noises like rustling leaves, flowing water, and distant winds. Interactive elements,
    such as the hum of candles or echoes in caverns, add tactile feedback and guide players through the world. Social interactions are enriched by harmonious chimes and musical instruments,
    fostering communication and community without words. Spatial audio creates a sense of presence, helping players locate companions or navigate hazards. Thematically, the audio aligns with the game’s focus on light,
    hope, and unity, supporting both narrative and visuals. Technically, the sound design is optimized across platforms, ensuring high fidelity and accessibility for all players.
    Together, these elements make Sky’s audio a masterful blend of artistry and functionality, elevating the game to a deeply engaging and memorable experience.</p>
